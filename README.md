Make `delete-by-moving-to-trash` do what you expect it to do on OS X.

For whatever reason GNU Emacs doesn’t support the system trash can on OS X.
Instead it’ll move files into the freedesktop.org trash can, which is, uhm, not
particularly useful behaviour on OS X.

This package makes Emacs do the right thing(TM) and move files to the real OS X
trash can.

**Note:** If you’re using the Emacs Mac Port, or if you’re not using OS X at
all, you’ll *not* need this package!

Setup
-----

Install this package from [MELPA][] or [MELPA Stable][], and add the following
to your init file:

```elisp
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (osx-trash-setup))
(setq delete-by-moving-to-trash t)
```

By default this package uses a bundled Applescript helper, but that is slow,
so you should customize `osx-trash-command` to use a faster external command.
