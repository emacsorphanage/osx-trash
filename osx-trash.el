;; Add support for system trash on OS X.  In other words, make
;; `delete-by-moving-to-trash' do what you expect it to do.
;;
;; Emacs does not support the system trash of OS X.  `system-move-file-to-trash'
;; is not defined.  This library provides `osx-trash-move-file-to-trash' as an
;; implementation of `system-move-file-to-trash' for OS X.
;;
;; `osx-trash-move-file-to-trash' tries to use `trash' utility from
;; https://github.com/ali-rantakari/trash (brew install trash).  If `trash' is
;; not available, the script falls back to an AppleScript helper which trashes
;; the file via finder.  `trash' is generally preferred, because AppleScript is
;; slow.
;;
;; To enable, call `osx-trash-setup' and set `delete-by-moving-to-trash' to a
;; non-nil value.

;;; Code:

(defconst osx-trash-pkg-file
  (expand-file-name (if load-in-progress load-file-name (buffer-file-name)))
  "The absolute path to this file.")

(defconst osx-trash-pkg-dir
  (file-name-directory osx-trash-pkg-file)
  "The absolute path to the directory of this package.")

(defconst osx-trash-script-file
  (expand-file-name "trashfile.AppleScript" osx-trash-pkg-dir))

(defun osx-trash-move-file-to-trash (file-name)
  "Move FILE-NAME to trash.

Try to call the `trash' utility first, because it's faster, and
fall back to AppleScript if `trash' wasn't found."
  (let ((file-name (expand-file-name file-name)))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (let ((retcode (condition-case nil
                         (call-process "trash" nil t nil "-F" file-name)
                       (error
                        (call-process "osascript" nil t nil
                                      osx-trash-script-file file-name)))))
        (unless (equal retcode 0)
          (error "Failed to trash %S: %S" file-name (buffer-string)))))))
